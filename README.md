# 02_Right_Angle_Triangle.
In this project, I have made a program that displays a Right Angle Triangle (using loops). This program is written in C-LANGUAGE and uses nested for-loops to print a shape like right angle triangle. The shape may have different number of rows depending on how many rows the user enters.
